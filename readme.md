Simple Chrome extension that removes watched videos from a channel's videos tab.  
I made this before realizing that Youtube already has this feature...
Welp, was still cool to learn how to make a Chrome extension. 1 hour project.

# Installation / Instructions
1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable Developer mode
3. 'Load unpacked' and select this repo
4. Use the hotkeys (`Ctrl + Shift + U`) to run while on a channel's videos tab
5. Toggle the hotkeys on and off to clear more videos as they load
6. Refresh the page to reset everything
